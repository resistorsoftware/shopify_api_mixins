      Your version of activeresource is too old, and does not support the `connection_class` method. Recommend you upgrade to master. Add this to your Gemfile, replacing any existing activeresource dependency:

      gem 'activeresource', git: 'https://github.com/rails/activeresource.git'

      Then run `bundle update activeresource`.
